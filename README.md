# Portofolio made with Python

## Development

To run the project on your machine do the following:

- go outside the `WebServer` folder and run `source WebServer/bin/activate`
- go back to `WebServer` folder and run `export FLASK_APP=server.py`
- now run `flask run`

The server is running on: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Since this is a Python project, the UI is a template from [`Mashup Template`](http://www.mashup-template.com/)
